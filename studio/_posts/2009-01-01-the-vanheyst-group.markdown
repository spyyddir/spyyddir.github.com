In 2008 I began working for VHG as an intern web developer. This was my first big project, and involved making some major changes from the previous design while maintaining the content and hooking into a custom backend system that was already in place.

I've made enhancements to the site since its initial launch, including a building a <a href="http://www.vanheyst.com/conferences/media/">media section</a> that automatically pulls content from the company's <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> account.
