When I was approached by <a href="http://sosmedia.org/">SOSMedia</a> to work on a site for this local band, I jumped at the opportunity. The design was great, and it had an interesting mix of requirements that catered well to my skills. I built nested javascript sliders, to allow all of the content the fit within one page, along with some php to ease the process of adding photos and videos to the gallery.
