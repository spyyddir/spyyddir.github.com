<p class="highlight">New! An updated <a href="/school">school work section</a>.</p>
<p>Hi, I&#x27;m Zac Clark, and I like to make web sites. I&#x27;m pretty good at it too. You should check out my <a href="/studio">work</a>.</p> 
<p>I live in beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado">Boulder, Colorado</a> and I&#x27;m currently studying computer science at the <a href="http://colorado.edu">University of Colorado</a>.</p> 
<p>I&#x27;m a firm believer that code should be beautiful, and I prefer to work with amazing tools like <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, but I also appreciate that there are <a href="http://php.net/">many</a> <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">solutions</a> to every problem. Contrary to some, I think html and css are great building tools, and I enjoy "getting my hands dirty" and working with them directly.</p> 
<p>If you want to get a peek into my life, I <a href="http://twitter.com/spyyddir">tweet</a>, and post my photos to <a href="http://flic.kr/spyyddir">Flickr</a>.</p>
