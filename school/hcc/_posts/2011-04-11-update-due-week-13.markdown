### What I did:

I started work on my class-specific web presence, and put up some cool docs/teaching aids for 2 design patterns in ruby. You can see the start of the work [here](http://zacclark.com/school/hcc/strategy.html). The pages are built with a tool called Rocco, which turns ruby source files with comments (in a specific format) into nicely readable code. The tool helps with the [Literate Programming Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), because it becomes very easy to mix docs and code.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

I was contacted by a local web dev shop about doing some contract work. They found me through a site I signed up on long ago ([http://bldr.im/](http://bldr.im/)). I signed up early in the site's life, so I'm still on the front page. That site linked them to my site, and they liked that they saw. Unfortunately, we found out I'm not exactly what they were looking for and my availability was too low, but it was a good experience about networking.

### How long I spent:

2 hours outside class.

### What I plan to do next week:

I'm going to spruce up my class website and add more code examples.
