### What I did:

I spent most of my time looking into generally applying the design patterns I've learned in OO Analysis & Design to ruby. We almost exclusively see examples in Java, which has quite different syntax and functionality to Ruby, so adapting the patterns can be a bit tricky at first.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

Worked with Tyler a bit and decided we were going to wait to do a &lt;DIV&gt; meeting because it was too short notice to try and have a meeting this week.

### How long I spent:

2 hours.

### What I plan to do next week:

I'm going to figure out how to apply these ruby patterns to rails, since the architecture is much more complicated to start from.
