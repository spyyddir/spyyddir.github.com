### What I did:

Worked on modeling a major revision to our code base to support some new features needed for the app.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

I've contacted Tyler Howarth, who expressed the most interest and drive in starting &lt;DIV&gt; back up with me. We hope to get something set up in the next couple weeks.

### How long I spent:

3 hours.

### What I plan to do next week:

Get a specific time and location for a first &lt;DIV&gt; meeting. Design formalized models and OO design for the new abstraction.
