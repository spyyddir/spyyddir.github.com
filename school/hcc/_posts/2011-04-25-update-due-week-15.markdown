### What I did:

I worked on my website for the class, which was a split between 3 projects. 1, finishing templating. 2, moving all my posts from here. 3, building a custom slideshow tool for my final presentation. I've always wanted to right my own html powered slideshow tool, as I'm not a huge fan of google docs. I figured I'd also build it into the Jekyll install I had already set up, so school slideshows can live beside the other things I've worked on.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

I haven't done much on it this week, but I did have a brief email exchange with a potential client that I had to turn down because I've already gotten a job for the summer.

### How long I spent:

7 hours. I got kind of carried away with writing my own stuff.
