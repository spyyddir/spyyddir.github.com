	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Junior in Computer Science</li>
		<li>Working part time at Van Heyst Group</li>
		<li>Interned at Everlater (Techstars company) last summer</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Semester Goals</h2>
	
	<p>Broadly: to have a chance to apply what I&#x27;ve been learning about programming and software engineering to my work. For a while my schedule had been too busy to have time for applying these new things that I had learned, so the hours for this class allowed me to bring the two disciplines together.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Bring testing into my workplace</li>
		<li>Show my bosses the value of refactoring</li>
		<li>Bring some of the agile methodologies I learned to our small team</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>From the Professional Awareness and Human Network angle, my goals were:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Networking with fellow students</li>
		<li>Restarting CU&lt;DIV&gt;</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Semester Goals (revisited)</h2>
	
	<p>As the semester progressed and I learned more in my other classes, I added some other goals:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Learn how to use Design Patterns in ruby</li>
		<li>Learn how to apply those ruby patterns to rails</li>
		<li>Rebuild my web presence</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Progress Report (success)</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Added a base of unit tests to our main project</li>
		<li>Taught my bosses more about agile and software development (including refactoring), and at least partially convinced them of its value</li>
		<li>Moved the team to a group issue tracker on Github for better communication</li>
		<li>Rebuilt many of the design patterns emphasized in CSCI 4448 in ruby</li>
		<li>Figured out how to work a subset of these patterns in Rails (strategy, sti)</li>
		<li>Ported my old web presence to Jekyll along with major changes</li>
		<li>Wrote a slideshow engine (powering this) in html/css/js</li>
		<li>Made some useful connections with other students at CU</li>
		<li>Built a base of connections for CU&lt;DIV&gt;</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Progress Report (failure)</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Never managed to get CU&lt;DIV&gt; to happen</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Tyler Howarth and I met on a few occasions to try and work on restarting the club, but neither of us had adequate time. I think the major problem was that we started too late in the year. By the time we felt ready to schedule a meeting, it was not worth it anymore.</p>
