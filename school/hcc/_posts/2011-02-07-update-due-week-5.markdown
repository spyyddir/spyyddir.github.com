### What I did:

Finished refactoring a major portion of the app dealing with saving person records, including adding tests for the major functionality.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

I started a thread on the google group looking for a co-organizer for reviving CU&lt;DIV&gt;.

### How long I spent:

I spent 3 hours this week.

### What I plan to do next week:

I want to refactor another area of the app that has been causing some trouble with aberrant behavior. Also, I'm going to get follow up on CU&lt;DIV&gt; stuff.
