### What I did:

I've fully implemented the STI pattern, and played with different ways to make use of the polymorphism it provides. The specific implementation also made use of ActiveRecord's built in serialization of more complicated objects into YAML stored in the database. Specifically, I'm using a serialized hash to store different settings for each submodel, and then writing accessors to write into the hash, rather than directly to instance variables. This allows the subclasses to nicely inherit all of their base classes functionality while having a unique set of attributes.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

My meeting with my old contact fell through due to scheduling problems. So we've been trying to find another time to meet. I've also been looking at different ways to connect professionally with colleagues online. I found an interesting site: [endor.se](http://endor.se/)

### How long I spent:

3 hours

### What I plan to do next week:

I'm going to put together some online resources about things I've worked on this semester. Teaching has always been a good way to solidify my knowledge, so I'm going to write about the patterns I've learned about in a way that can (hopefully) be shared.
