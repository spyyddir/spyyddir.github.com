### What I did:

This week I spent all my time working on my website and portfolio. I've been wanting to update my website's organization, and make it more editable so I can add recent projects to my portfolio easily. I like learning new technologies, so I re-built sections of my website using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which is a Ruby based static site generator. It takes a set of template files and individual content files (written within some markup language, like Markdown), and converts them into a full website statically. This means each file exists as self-contained html, rather that hitting a database (like with tools like Wordpress). Doing this makes it easy to archive and host anywhere, as well as keeping your site resilient to high traffic. Github offers runs Jekyll for their users so that anyone can create &lt;theirusername&gt;.github.com. You can [check out my site](http://spyyddir.github.com/) or [view the source](https://github.com/spyyddir/spyyddir.github.com).

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

I've worked on updating my portfolio and website so I can give out my website to people I meet professionally.

### How long I spent:

3 and a half hours.

### What I plan to do next week:

For the last week of the class I'm going to work on finishing my website and putting together a presentation for the final time slot.
