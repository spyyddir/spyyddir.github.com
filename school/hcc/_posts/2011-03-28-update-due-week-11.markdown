### What I did:

I learned a lot about creating complicated class structures within rails, mostly around making tools that live in the /lib directory and are accessed by the rest of the application. Up until recently, all my experience with rails had fallen within the strictly defined MVC structure. Lately, I've needed to do some things outside of that, and now I've found how to do it well.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

I've been working with Ben Limmer on a group project.

### How long I spent:

3 hours

### What I plan to do next week:

Near the end of this week I discovered an interesting pattern supported by rails called STI (single table inheritance), which allows multiple different subclasses to easily be linked to the same table in the database. I understand the basics of how the pattern works, but I want to dive into it more fully. Also, from a human network side, I'm going to catch up with an old contact in the tech/freelancing industry.
