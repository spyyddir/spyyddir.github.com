### What I did:

I primarily spent time working on my Human Network this week, but also refactored the location of a very early method in my application. It made sense originally, but since the application has grown its location was nor longer relevant. I moved it to a better location and began work on the proper method for the old location.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

I worked with Tyler Howarth on starting CU&lt;DIV&gt;. We had a meeting about goals and plans, contacted SOFO about starting an official group, and contacted the original founders.

### How long I spent:

3 hours.

### What I plan to do next week:

Hopefully SOFO will get back to us on the student group, so Tyler and I can plan the first DIV meeting.
