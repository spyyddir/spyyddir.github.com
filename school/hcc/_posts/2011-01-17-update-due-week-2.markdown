### What I did:

I spent time working on my project idea. This involved talking to my bosses and making sure that they were ok with the arrangement, as well as getting the project approved by Clayton. After that, I started to work on refactoring a specific piece of the application according to some Ruby on Rails best practices (namely: Skinny Controller, Fat Model).

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

In class I met some students that I had taken classes with before, but never actually talked to. This includes the student who interned at the same office as I did last summer.

### How long I spent:

I worked about 3 hours outside of class.

### What I plan to do next week:

I plan to continue refactoring the code in my project to be more testable, so I can write unit tests later in the semester. For my human network I want to investigate what happened to CU&lt;DIV&gt;.
