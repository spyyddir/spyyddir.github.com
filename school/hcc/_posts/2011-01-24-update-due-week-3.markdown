### What I did:

In an effort to move the application to a more testable state, I've been refactoring the app according to the Skinny Controller, Fat Model idea, which is to keep most logic out of the controllers and put it in the model. This is more testable, as models can be unit tested, as well as being easier to read.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

I'm getting in contact with Cameron Robertson, a CU alum who had created the CU&lt;DIV&gt; web dev group on campus. The group hasn't met for a while, and I'm looking into starting it back up again.

### How long I spent:

I spent 2.5 hours on work this week.

### What I plan to do next week:

Stay the course, mostly. I want to increase my progress on refactoring and find out specific details on starting CU&lt;DIV&gt; back up from Cameron.
