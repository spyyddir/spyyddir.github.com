### What I did:

I did very little this week, which I'm going to make up for next week. I had a midterm Monday, another Friday, then one the following Monday and two on Tuesday. I felt my time was better spent studying.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

Established better connection with some classmates.

### How long I spent:

1 hour outside class.

### What I plan to do next week:

Catch up on missed work this week, including scheduling a time to meet with Tyler and refactoring more code.
