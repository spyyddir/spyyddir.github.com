### What I did:

This week was mainly spent on my human network. For my main project, I've had some success convincing the other developer on my team to also focus on test coverage.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

Tyler Howarth and I went to Startups2Students and did some networking. We found some good resources for CU&lt;DIV&gt; including people willing to speak, as well as interested in giving tours of their offices or getting us other new contacts.

### How long I spent:

2 hours.

### What I plan to do next week:

Schedule a time a rent a room for the first CU&lt;DIV&gt; meeting.
