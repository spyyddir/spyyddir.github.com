### What I did:

I continued work on making my app better reflect OO design and agile methods. I've delegated work better across various models, and gotten to the point where I can start adding tests, of which I created the first few sets.

### What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:

I've begun communications with the founders of CU&lt;DIV&gt; about getting it up and running again.

### How long I spent:

4 and a half hours.

### What I plan to do next week:

Right now my tests are only functioning on very small specific chunks of code, so I want to create integration tests to see how the app is functioning as a whole. I also want to look around for someone interested in running &lt;DIV&gt; with me.
