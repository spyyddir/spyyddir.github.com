title: On Pacif(ic)ism

The principal basis of the pacifist argument is the idea that human life has extreme value; indeed, value beyond much else. The argument posed by Richard Norman specifically goes into the idea that "life", in this case, is the act of living, not simply the biological definition of life. In doing so, the lives of those in comas, or with brain damage, are not considered, but we also remove the need to consider the "lives" of plants, other animals, etc.
  
With the argument narrowed down to this scope, the specific case for pacifism (and pacificism, which is not as absolutest, and is argued for by Norman) can be made. Prior, pacifism's claims of right-action would rule out the ability for farmers to do their job, or hunters, etc. The argument would be totally lost in the complete unfeasibility of its scope. Still, the feasibility argument will arise, but within this narrower scope of "to live a full life", we may combat it efficiently.

Now, within the human scope: in the arguments presented by Norman, killing should not be seen only...
  
> "...as the destruction of a biological conditions but as depriving someone of the opportunity actively to live his or her own life." (#1, Norman, p200)

So, what is wrong with the destruction of a life, as defined above? By killing someone, you have totally destroyed their life, and damaged the lives of many others. Each human life is unique, and so each one of us affects others in an irreplaceable way. A utilitarian argument here would not get to the heart of it because, as Norman puts it:

> "We could speak of the one person's loss being cancelled out by the other person's gains only if values could be computed in some impersonal way, apart from the context of human lives." (#1, Norman, p200-201)

Norman's take on pacificism can be seen as a "less strict" or "more feasible" take on the pacifist philosophy, as it does not completely outlaw killing:

> "...the principle of not taking human life cannot be maintained as an absolute principle." (#1, Norman, p201)

In his first example for this we must consider two individuals (A and B), where A is threatening B's life. Here, A, by choosing to violate B's right to life, has given up his own. A is responsible for there being a choice between two lives, so his is forfeit. B would be justified in killing him. Norman's pacifism can allow self defense.

By allowing this, Norman has showed that his view on Pacificism allows for special considerations under which the taking of human life is permissible. This backs up his earlier point that the principle of not killing cannot be made absolute. But, while not absolute, the principle is, as Norman puts it, _fundamental_. It has exceptions, but these very much are special cases, not simply common circumstances. His view on Pacificism does not go so far as to lose its peaceful core, but he has certainly departed his views from the common definition of pacifism:

> "The best place to begin an analysis of pacifism is with the absolutist argument that all forms of violence, war, and/or killing are unconditionally wrong. The proposed ideal is that social intercourse should be completely non-violent and peaceful, and conflicts which may arise should be dealt with through arbitration and compromise rather than with recourse to violent means. Absolutist pacifism asserts that peace is intrinsically a good to be upheld either as a duty or on the consequentialist grounds that it is more conducive to human welfare than any use of violence or force." (#2, IEP)

This has causes issue with other philosophers, some of whom seem to think he "falls short". One specific example is Soran Reader, who has this to say:

> "Norman prefers to think of himself as a 'pacificist' -- someone who morally disapproves of war, but believes that in some contexts it is a morally defensible course of action." (#3, Reader, p170)

Reader thinks that Pacifism can be argued for strongly (and feasibly) without need for the contingencies that Norman places on it. Specifically, she focuses on the application of justified self defense to an impersonal level, such as that of war. The problem with its application to war, is that on an individual level soldiers know very little about those they kill. They do not know, in many cases, that their target seeks to kill them, or poses the means to do so. The justification, then, cannot by given.

I think, though, that Norman does not so easily permit war. He argues against the justification Walzer gives for self defense: the defense of communities equates to the defense of individual rights. Walzer's argument, boiled down, goes something like this:

1. Individual's rights are important (Norman agrees)
2. Communities uphold and defend the rights of their members
3. Defense of a community is defense of human rights
4. Therefore, defending communities is justified

The problems with this are twofold. One, a communities existence is not directly analogous to the existence of its members. Even in the case of the total destruction of a community, those who previously inhabited it will likely be able to continue the traditions and individual traits that built up the community, though possibly in a modified form. Second:

> "Even if their community has completely disintegrated, individuals live on. They may perhaps create a new identity for themselves within the conquering society, or as refugees they may find a place in the life of some other community." (#1, Norman, p204)

Here there is a minor contradiction with a point Norman made about the _unique_ value of living. He says, in regards to the death of one person: 

> "It can not be compensated for, just because the values promoted for others will not compensate for the person who has been killed." (#1, Norman, p200)

The extension of this is that the experiences that make up a person are unique and cannot be replaced, __but__ he then argues that the self-identity destroyed along with a community can be replaced with a new one in another community. How can the individuality be valued and replaceable at the same time?

I think Norman would refute that by making the distinction that the part of the person's identity wrapped up in their community is only a piece of their whole being, and that its "death" matters less that that of the individual, as defined by all their experiences to date. Still, this is a troubling contradiction.

Working from the former (and stronger) argument against defense of a community, Norman shows that the defense of a community does not satisfy the conditions needed to justify violence. Though, he does set aside case of genocide as a special case, because it seeks to not only destroy the community, but also all of its members.

Norman's next attack on an attempt to justify war is to use the just-war theorist's (JWT) own idea against him. In JWT, non-combatants are seen as morally innocent and therefore attacks against them are not only unjustified, they are morally reprehensible. But, what makes combatants guilty, where non-combatants are innocent? The simple answer here is the "attempt to destroy you", but that seems to not be true of all combatants, and to indeed be true of some non-combatants. Norman cites Jeffrie Murphy's example comparing "an avid supporter of Hitler" with "a poor, frightened, pacifist soldier on the front line". Is not the civilian in that case more responsible for aggression than the drafted soldier?

With this problem, we must limit the scope to those actions which directly commit aggression, such as the case where two soldiers are actively exchanging fire. In this case, the only options for each are to die by the other's bullets or to take their life. This is very much closer to the original A vs B example, and is the only place within the war that one soldier may be justified in killing another.

By showing it in this light, Norman changes the application of non-combatant immunity. As he puts it:

> "The theory is supposed to justify combatants killing enemy combatants in order to win; in fact it will only justify killing combatants in order to survive." (#1, Norman, p206)

With this, again, the special case is genocide. There, the fight is _by definition_ for survival, so justification of violence is easier to reach.

In this, Reader agrees, arguing that "harm to an individual" is what justifies violence, not "war between states". She, however, goes farther in her claims. Norman allows for the justification of specific soldiers killing each other in self defense from the other, but Reader presents that this:

> "...amounts to a mass of chaotic self-defense killing in ignorance, which has as little necessary connection with the rational intentions of the communities these soldiers represent, as any riot or bar-room brawl." (#3, Reader, p177)

To be clear, in this quotation, Reader argues against this as a justification for war, but does not condemn the soldiers involved. They should not have been placed in this situation, but, being there, are allowed to defend themselves.

The arguments above come all come from a rights-based approach, but attacks on pacifism come from the utilitarian camp as well. Norman provides a consequentialist foundation for it as well. In brief, the large problem with wars is that they are a very poor gamble. Yes, it is possible for a war to have a net positive result in terms of happiness. But, this is not a necessarily a likely outcome, while death, destruction and pain (in large amounts) are a certainty. Norman leaves open the possibility that there be circumstances where this gamble looks like a good one, but shows that it usually is not.

With all this, however, there is a large problem: feasibility. It seems easy to argue against Pacifism on the grounds that it simply cannot work. In the face of an incoming oppressor, what choice is there but war? How can pacifists stand any chance against an army?

Reader argues that a needed basis for Pacifism is a more pre-emptive world outlook. We must not wait for a tyrant to rise, seeing it as something external to our own lives, until they attack. We must see every community as one community. If some thing or some one (like a tyrant) rises, it is _everyone's_ problem, not just that of those living in that area:

> "...if tyranny affects person, it is the concern of persons everywhere. The _location_ of the tyrant, and _which people_ he tyrannises, make no moral difference to what may or should be done to him;" (#3, Reader, p172)

She does not go into specifics about _how_ to address these issues peacefully, only that doing so early will prevent there ever being the "Hitler is coming!" situation, where war seems like the only option. This certainly seems plausible, though it does not present a position on what to do if this ever does arise. Here, we must infer from her later arguments for the justification of political assassination:

> "...there is no moral reason why it cannot permit the use of perfectly discriminate, targeted violence for which the agents can be held morally responsible... A plausible pacifism, then, might well be one that condones the use of hit-squads." (#3, Reader, p179)

Here, then, even Reader's more strict pacifism gives way to violence as a last resort. A pacificist would agree (Norman also specifically mentions assassination), but also would potentially be open to the idea of a defensive war, especially if, with the Hitler example, genocide was a fear. Still, Norman argues that violence can still be avoided:

> "In particular, institutional procedures for settling disputes without recourse to war, and traditions of non-violent resistance to invasion and oppression, can gradually be built up." (#1, Norman, p209)

So even the less absolutest side argues that, in the face of aggression, peace can still be an option. However, non-violent resistance is subject to a number of caveats. Most important, it requires that the oppressor acts within just war theory: that its soldiers do not shoot the innocent, that it does not wage a war against the non-combatant population. Walzer considers this to be damning, but it is a weaker argument than it seems.

Much of the conventional war strategy depends on the same conventions. If we were to go to war to defend ourselves from aggression, we would need them to rely on the same conventions. If, however, they use prohibited weapons, target civilian centers, and in general throw war convention to the wind, we are as lost as if we had laid down arms.

This point do not do much to strengthen the argument from pacifism, but rather weakens the argument from what Reader would call "the war-ist". If going to war is not a better option that pacifism in that special conditions, and indeed, is a worse option in the other, more common cases, the case is made for a peaceful solution.
