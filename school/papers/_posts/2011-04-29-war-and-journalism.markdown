Journalists play an interesting role in the morality of war. Certainly their impact needs to be addressed within areas of non-combatant immunity, collateral harm, just means (use of journalists as military strategy), non-violent resistance, and humanitarian intervention.

First off, we shall look at non-combatant immunity. Where does the embedded journalist fall in this classification? Certainly they are not normal combatants. They are not soldiers, they do not try to harm (directly) either side. If we're working with the traditional bipolar view, there would be no argument here. But, I think it is worth the investigation into where they lie along a spectrum from morally guilty (combatant) to morally innocent (civilian). There has been some discussion in our class of widening the scope of "combatant" to include those responsible for the war, such as politicians. If this were expanded, it would probably look something like the following (from most guilt to least):

- __Front-line soldier__: They are directly involved in active fighting. They are _by definition_ the closest to a "combatant".
- __Support field soldier__ _(artillery, driver, radio-operator, etc)_: They are also involved in active fighting, but in a supporting role.
- __Support base soldier__ _(mechanic, cook, IT support, etc)_: They are not generally directly involved in combat, but their effects are chiefly to aid those who are.
- __Civilian command__ _(president (commander-in-chief), politicians in relevant positions)_: These people, while not fighting, generally are responsible for the fighting, because they are the ones who declare and administrate the war.
- __Other government leaders__: This, and for the rest down, are basically just varying amounts of guilt by association. It would be hard to argue that people in these roles are morally guilty, but represent potentially more justifiable targets than those further down.
- Government workers
- Taxpayers
- Other

So, where should war journalists fit in this? Certainly below the soldiers, as they're not involved in combat, either directly or indirectly. They are likely to _be there_, but in a neutral capacity. Not, the matter of the journalists role comes into play. Are they responsible for war propaganda or simply showing the truth? In the first case they should count as part of the war effort, in an indirect role. I would argue that this role is "less guilty" than that of civilian command, but more than other government leaders. Like civilian commanders, the propaganda journalist is indirectly involved in the war. Unlike them, the journalist is not directly responsible for declaring or administrating the war. On the other hand, the journalist who is simply searching for the truth should be much farther down on the list. In either case, the journalist _is not_ a combatant. This should be very clear, but they do not fight, make claim to fight, or wear the uniform of either side.

<!-- collateral harm -->

Once we realize that journalists are covered by non-combatant immunity, there are still issues to be addressed regarding collateral harm. Because war journalists (specifically ones embedded with troops) deliberately put themselves in harms way, their deaths as a result of collateral harm should be dealt with differently than civilians. In the case of civilians, part of the issue with their death is (in many cases), they have no choice about being in the situation. Consider the case where military forces take shelter within a civilian apartment building. The residents have no say in this. They cannot make the soldiers leave, nor should they be required to abandon their homes in this situation to retain their right to life. Journalists, however, have made the choice to be close to the fighting, knowing full well of the risks involved. Because of this, the moral weight associated with their harm (in the case of collateral damage) should be lower than that of normal civilians.

While their loss is no less tragic, it is more likely to happen, and harder to avoid. It seems strange to hear that an Oscar nominee died in a battle, but when you realize that they were a documentary film maker and war journalist, the shock turns to sadness at the likely event. Tim Hetherington, the director of _Restrepo_, was killed by an RPG in Libya while near front-line fighting. To reiterate, I'm not saying that their deaths are justified, but that, given their choices to be in such dangerous situations, they are perhaps more excusable.

<!-- ## just means (use of journalists as military strategy) -->

We have discussed acts on journalists, but not yet acts by journalists. Because they can be employed as part of a military strategy, their use should be studied for just means. How can journalists be used in war? Mainly, as mentioned above, for propaganda. Used correctly, journalists have the power to portray either side in a conflict in varying lights. This isn't exactly a "weapon", but we could evaluate it as such with a few of the methods used to prohibit weapons. Certainly is passes the mortality tests, but the more interesting question here is that of "giving a fair fight". The answer to this question is actually quite tricky.

On the face of it, propaganda does not fit with the other weapons that avoid a fair fight, such as blinding lasers. But, how can one really fight against propaganda? The war on information is a much more complicated beast, especially when the psychology of belief comes in. Done well, a campaign of propaganda would be very hard to combat. A counter-information attack only has so much chance of success. This attack is less like a strategic counter, and more akin to damage control. Actively fighting back against propaganda would probably take the form of trying to destroy distribution of the message, rather than the message itself. That said, it would be hard to make a complete case for banning its use, as it isn't directly damaging to anyone in particular. It certainly does not have the "loaded wince factor".

Another use of journalists, as shown in the movie _Spy Game_, is (as the title suggests) as spies. Journalists often have unprecedented access to both sides of a conflict because they are seen as a neutral party. In the movie, Robert Redford's character (a CIA agent), recruits a war photographer (played by Brad Pitt) for a field agent. Throughout the movie, the two use Pitt's cover as a journalist to get him into areas he would otherwise be refused entry. This, I think, is an example of behavior that should be banned by war conventions. It strikes me as similar to this piece from The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on War:

> Soldiers may not use weapons or methods which are "evil in themselves." These include: mass rape campaigns; genocide or ethnic cleansing; using poison or treachery (like disguising soldiers to look like the Red Cross)

While hiding spies among a pool of reporters is less horrific than hiding soldiers under the banner of an aid group, it is a similar sort of action, and would also fall under treachery. If this sort of action became common, our ability to learn about conflicts would be heavily damaged. If resistance groups had to fear reporters because they might be spies, rather than doing their job of getting the truth out, the access that real journalists get to these situation would be severely limited.

<!-- ## terrorism (ish) -->


<!-- ## non-violent resistance -->

Moving to less violent topics, journalists can play an extremely important role in successful non violent resistance and uprising. If the aggressor decides to break war conventions and begins targeting the protestors (or anyone practicing resistance), one of the recourses available to the oppressed is to get their message out to the rest of the world. Without journalists, this message is less likely be broadcast and seen. Yes, the rise of cheap cameras and near ubiquitous internet has decreased the need for specific journalists, but the integrity that comes along with the official title and backing of a world news organization can be a great help. It seems hard enough to get humanitarian aid in the event of human rights abuses even with proper reporting. If the only news coming out of a country is from un-vetted internet sources, the chance of legitimate help is low.

From an internal standpoint, journalists still play an important role. Communication is key to successful non-violent resistance. Journalists are one of the forms this communication can take. Especially in the chaos that envelopes countries during rebellion, a reliable news source could prove monumentally important to those rising up. As news of successes spread, moral and popular support would likely rise as well.

<!-- ## humanitarian intervention & self determination. -->

The journalists job is critical for humanitarian intervention. As with non-violent resistance, getting the word out is an important step. Intervention cannot happen unless some power is moved to intervene. Without reporting of a crisis, no one will be called to action. A question does arise here: does the presence of journalists during a civil war undermine their chances at self-determination? Probably so. For example, it is likely that, without news coming out of Somalia via reporters and journalists, that the UN would not have attempted their botched humanitarian intervention, as partially shown in _Black Hawk Down_. While the film focuses on the Battle of Mogadishu, the film does set up support for the intervention through scenes depicting the disregard for human rights shown by the forces in power. However, the movie does not mention any of the issue around interfering in an ongoing civil war. Likely, had their not been journalistic evidence of the atrocities, the UN would not have sent in peacekeepers.

Another issue journalists have to face around war is that of competing representations of the conflict. Often, dramatized takes on a battle (such as television or movies) gain more viewership than factual reports. For example, the film _The Hurt Locker_ has received some negative reactions from veterans for its portrayal of soldiers:

> "The Hurt Locker tries to articulate that experience, but those of us who have served in the military couldn't help but be distracted by a litany of inaccuracies that reveal not only a lack of research, but ultimately respect for the American military...The scene with Jeremy Renner's character sneaking off base to chase a boy he is worried about is as fictional as Jason Bourne and is not representative of the real military experience in Iraq...his is not indicative of those of us who served there. The men in my platoon followed rules and orders" (#5)

It seems irresponsible for people who have their opinions based off of these fictional accounts of war, rather than on the factual reports and documentaries, like _Restrepo_. Those journalists working on getting the news out have a commitment to spreading the truth of the situation, not a sensationalized depiction of war meant to make money.

<!-- extra / conclusion -->

In the end, the journalists primary role is to show to people whether the war is justified or not. Through their lenses and pens, they show the costs of war, the means of war, and the effects of war to all those watching. Without them, how would we even begin to judge a war? Their place is curial to the very foundations of just war theory, for without the knowledge they impart we would be baseless in our judgements. Historians may have access to more records, and then have more time to garner stories from multiple sides of a conflict, but, while it is happening, our only reliable knowledge as to its legitimacy is through the journalist.

Often, they also bring a level of humanity and "close-to-home" relativism to conflicts, showing readers or viewers the people at the heart of conflicts. It can be easy to get lost in the statistics of war, without realizing that, on either side, it really is _people_ shooting at other _people_. Journalists can help us see this; help us see that our soldiers don't make up a faceless war machine; that those we fight are people with families and friends and lives.
